                            The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of 
                            superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are based on characters that appear in American comic books 
                            published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes television series, short films, digital series, and 
                            literature. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing 
                            over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.

                            Marvel Studios releases its films in groups called "Phases", with the first three phases collectively known as "The 
                            Infinity Saga" and the following three phases as "The Multiverse Saga". The first MCU film, Iron Man (2008), began 
                            Phase One, which culminated in the 2012 crossover film The Avengers. Phase Two began with Iron Man 3 (2013) and 
                            concluded with Ant-Man (2015). Phase Three began with Captain America: Civil War (2016) and concluded with 
                            Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). Phase Four began with Black Widow (2021) and concluded with Black Panther: Wakanda 
                            Forever (2022). Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) began Phase Five, which will end with Captain America: Brave 
                            New World (2025), and Phase Six will begin with Fantastic Four (2025). Phase Six and "The Multiverse Saga" will 
                            conclude with Avengers: The Kang Dynasty (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027).

                            Marvel Television expanded the universe to network television with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in 2013 before 
                            further expanding to streaming television on Netflix and Hulu and to cable television on Freeform. They also produced 
                            the digital series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot. Marvel Studios began producing their own television series for 
                            streaming on Disney+, starting with WandaVision in 2021 as the beginning of Phase Four. They also expanded to 
                            television specials in Phase Four, known as Marvel Studios Special Presentations, the first of which was Werewolf by 
                            Night (2022). The MCU also includes tie-in comics published by Marvel Comics, a series of direct-to-video short films 
                            called Marvel One-Shots, and viral marketing campaigns for the films featuring the faux news programs WHIH Newsfront

                            By 2005, Marvel Entertainment had begun planning to produce its own films independently and distribute them through 
                            Paramount Pictures. Previously, Marvel had co-produced several superhero films with Columbia Pictures, New Line 
                            Cinema and others, including a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox. Marvel made relatively little 
                            profit from its licensing deals with other studios and wanted to get more money out of its films while maintaining 
                            artistic control of the projects and distribution. Avi Arad, head of Marvel's film division, was pleased with Sam 
                            Raimi's Spider-Man films at Sony Pictures, but was less pleased with others. As a result, Arad decided to form Marvel 
                            Studios, Hollywood's first major independent film studio since DreamWorks Pictures. Kevin Feige, Arad's 
                            second-in-command, realized that unlike Spider-Man, Blade, and the X-Men, whose film rights were licensed to Sony, 
                            New Line Cinema, and Fox, respectively, Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the Avengers. Feige, a 
                            self-described "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe, just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done 
                            with their comic books in the early 1960s.

                            To raise capital, the studio secured funding from a seven-year, $525 million revolving credit facility with Merrill 
                            Lynch. Marvel's plan was to release individual films for their main characters and then merge them in a crossover 
                            film. Arad doubted the strategy, but insisted

                            that it was his reputation that helped secure the initial financing. He 
                            resigned the following year. In 2007, at 33 years old, Feige was named studio chief. In order to preserve its 
                            artistic integrity, Marvel Studios formed a creative committee of six people familiar with its comic book lore: 
                            Feige, Marvel Studios co-president Louis D'Esposito, Marvel Comics' president of publishing Dan Buckley, Marvel's 
                            chief creative officer Joe Quesada, writer Brian Michael Bendis, and Marvel Entertainment president Alan Fine, who 
                            oversaw the committee. Feige initially referred to the shared narrative continuity of these films as the "Marvel 
                            Cinema Universe", but later used the term "Marvel Cinematic Universe". Since the franchise expanded to other media, 
                                this phrase has been used by some to refer to the feature films only.

                            In October 2014, Marvel Studios held a press event to announce the titles of their Phase Three films. By September 
                            2015, after Marvel Studios was integrated into Walt Disney Studios with Feige reporting to Walt Disney Studios 
                            chairman Alan F. Horn instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter,[13] the studios' creative committee had 
                            "nominal" input on the films moving forward, though they continued to consult on Marvel Television productions, which 
                            remained under Perlmutter's control. All key film decisions going forward were to be made by Feige, D'Esposito and 
                            Victoria Alonso. Feige mentioned that Avengers: Endgame (2019) would provide "a definitive end" to the films and 
                            storylines preceding it, with the franchise having "two distinct periods. Everything before [Endgame] and everything 
                            after". He later said Phase Three would conclude "The Infinity Saga".

                            By November 2017, Disney was looking to develop a new Marvel television series for their streaming service Disney+.
                            In July 2018, Feige noted discussions had begun with Disney regarding any potential involvement Marvel Studios could 
                            have with the streaming service, since Feige felt the service was "an important thing for the company". In September 
                            2018, it was reported that Marvel Studios was developing several limited series centered on "second-tier" characters 
                            from the MCU films who had not and were unlikely to star in their own films. Each series was expected to be six to 
                            eight episodes, and would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, with Feige taking a "hands-on 
                            role" in each series' development. Feige noted the series being developed for the streaming service would "tell 
                            stories... that we wouldn't be able to tell in a theatrical experience – a longer-form narrative". He also added that 
                            being asked by Disney to create these series "energized everyone creatively" within Marvel Studios, since they "could 
                            play in a new medium and throw the rules out the window in terms of structure and format". Television specials from 
                            the studio are marketed as "Marvel Studios Special Presentations". The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022), 
                            a Special Presentation, was the first piece of content Marvel Studios planned to create for Disney+.

                            If...?. Alonso confirmed that Marvel Studios had around 31 projects in various stages of development by September 
                            2021. In April 2022, Feige said he and Marvel Studios were on a creative retreat to plan and discuss the MCU films 
                            for the following 10 years. That July, Feige announced some of the films and series for Phase Five and Phase Six at 
                            San Diego Comic-Con, revealing that the second three Phases were collectively known as "The Multiverse Saga". Feige
                            explained that Marvel Studios realized during development on Phase Four that it would be different from the first 
                            three phases, with more projects over a shorter period of time. This also came after the "creative experience" of 
                            ending Phase Three and "The Infinity Saga" with Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame. Therefore, 
                            instead of "culminat[ing] every 10 months in an Avengers movie" they decided to leave that culmination until the end 
                            of "The Multiverse Saga", with the second three phases all building to Avengers: The Kang Dynasty (2026) and 
                            Avengers: Secret Wars (2027). Marvel Studios was excited to explore Kang the Conqueror as an overarching villain of 
                            the Multiverse Saga after Thanos in the Infinity Saga, because Kang was a uniquely different villain in part because 
                            he has multiple variants. Additionally, the studio was not initially planning to have the next saga revolve around 
                            Kang, but decided to after seeing actor Jonathan Majors' performance in the first season of Loki (2021) and the 
                            dailies while filming Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023).

                    In March 2023, Alonso was fired from her role at Marvel Studios by a group including Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan 
                    Bergman and Disney's human resources and legal departments for serving as a producer on the Amazon Studios film Argentina, 
                    1985 (2022); this was a breach of a 2018 agreement between Alonso and Disney which stated employees would not work for a 
                    competing studio. Alonso reportedly did not seek permission to work on the film, and was asked by Disney to stop working on 
                    the film, as well as not to promote or publicize it, with the situation "deemed serious enough" that Disney requested a new 
                    agreement be signed. Despite this, Alonso continued to promote the film following its September 2022 premiere, and was 
                    consistently reminded of her agreement and breach of contract, ultimately leading to her firing. Alonso's lawyers refuted 
                    this claim, stating Disney was aware of, and agreed to, Alonso's work on Argentina, 1985, and that she was instead "silenced
                    [... and] was terminated when she refused to do something she believed was reprehensible"; this incident was reported to be a 
                    disagreement with a Disney executive over the censoring of gay pride elements in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in order 
                    to release the film in Kuwait and comply with its restrictive anti-LGBTQ laws. A Disney spokesperson reiterated the notion 
                    that she was fired due to "an indisputable breach of contract and a direct violation of company policy" among other "key 
                    factors". Disney and Alonso reached a multi-million dollar compensation settlement in April.
