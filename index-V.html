                            Stan Lee (born Stanley Martin Lieber; December 28, 1922 – November 12, 2018) was an American comic book 
                            writer, editor, publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run business called Timely Comics 
                            which would later become Marvel Comics. He was the primary creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion 
                            from a small division of a publishing house to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics and film industries.

                            trademark motto, "Excelsior!" (which is also the New York state motto). To maintain his workload and meet deadlines, 
                            he used a system that was used previously by various comic-book studios, but due to Lee's success with it, became 
                            known as the "Marvel Method". Typically, Lee would brainstorm a story with the artist and then prepare a brief 
                            synopsis rather than a full script. Based on the synopsis, the artist would fill the allotted number of pages by 
                            determining and drawing the panel-to-panel storytelling. After the artist turned in penciled pages,

                    Lee would write the word balloons and captions, and then oversee the lettering and coloring. In effect, the artists were co-plotters, 
                    whose collaborative first drafts Lee built upon. For his part, Lee endeavored to use a sophisticated vocabulary in his dialogue and 
                    captions to encourage his young readers to learn new words, often playfully noting “If a kid has to go to a dictionary, that’s not 
                    the worst thing that could happen.”

                    Following Ditko's departure from Marvel in 1966, John Romita Sr. became Lee's collaborator on The Amazing Spider-Man. Within 
                    a year, it overtook Fantastic Four to become the company's top seller. Lee and Romita's stories focused as much on the social 
                    and college lives of the characters as they did on Spider-Man's adventures. The stories became more topical, addressing 
                    issues such as the Vietnam War, political elections, and student activism. Robbie Robertson, introduced in The Amazing 
                    Spider-Man #51 (August 1967) was one of the first African-American characters in comics to play a serious supporting role. In 
                    the Fantastic Four series, the lengthy run by Lee and Kirby produced many acclaimed storylines as well as characters that 
                    have become central to Marvel, including the Inhumans and the Black Panther, an African king who would be mainstream comics' 
                    first black superhero.

                    The story frequently cited as Lee and Kirby's finest achievement is the three-part "Galactus Trilogy" that began in Fantastic 
                    Four #48 (March 1966), chronicling the arrival of Galactus, a cosmic giant who wanted to devour the planet, and his herald, 
                    the Silver Surfer. Fantastic Four #48 was chosen as #24 in the 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time poll of Marvel's readers in 
                    2001. Editor Robert Greenberger wrote in his introduction to the story that "As the fourth year of the Fantastic Four came to 
                    a close, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby seemed to be only warming up. In retrospect, it was perhaps the most fertile period of any 
                    monthly title during the Marvel Age." Comics historian Les Daniels noted that "[t]he mystical and metaphysical elements that 
                    took over the saga were perfectly suited to the tastes of young readers in the 1960s", and Lee soon discovered that the story 
                    was a favorite on college campuses. Lee and artist John Buscema launched The Silver Surfer series in August 1968.

                    The following year, Lee and Gene Colan created the Falcon, comics' first African-American superhero, in Captain America #117 
                    (September 1969). In 1971, Lee indirectly helped reform the Comics Code. The U. S. Department of Health, Education and 
                    Welfare had asked Lee to write a comic-book story about the dangers of drugs and Lee conceived a three-issue subplot in The 
                    Amazing Spider-Man #96–98 (cover-dated May–July 1971), in which Peter Parker's best friend becomes addicted to prescription 
                    drugs. The Comics Code Authority refused to grant its seal because the stories depicted drug use; the anti-drug context was 
                    considered irrelevant. With Goodman's cooperation and confident that the original government request would give him 
                    credibility, Lee had the story published without the seal. The comics sold well and Marvel won praise for its socially 
                    conscious efforts. The CCA subsequently loosened the Code to permit negative depictions of drugs, among other new freedoms.

                    Lee also supported using comic books to provide some measure of social commentary about the real world, often dealing with 
                    racism and bigotry. "Stan's Soapbox", besides promoting an upcoming comic book project, also addressed issues of 
                    discrimination, intolerance, or prejudice.

                    In 1972, Lee stopped writing monthly comic books to assume the role of publisher. His final issue of The Amazing Spider-Man 
                    was #110 (July 1972)[121] and his last Fantastic Four was #125 (August 1972).
